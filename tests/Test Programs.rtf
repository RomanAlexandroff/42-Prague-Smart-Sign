Test Programs\
\
This folder contains some of the 42 Prague Smart Sign functionalities\
which were extracted from the main project into their own small programs\
for the reasons of testing and debugging. The programs may give some\
insight on the development process and help with the future debugging.\
All the programs are heavily commented and have notes on some\
tests and debugging processes.\
